1. Honestly, I would just clean up the styling / probably would re-do the
   origional framework to follow that of a typical online menu (pictures, ect).
   In addition, I would probably add a few css animations and clean up the
   styling. Another option would to make it into a web-app that actually 
   handled the orders. 

2. The thing I like the least about Javascript is its loosly-typed syntax.
   I touched a bit on this in a past assignment about javascript. Some people
   may like the freedom (I used to be one of them), however, I think 
   strongly-typed langauges provide me with a better framework to write code 
   using "good practices".
